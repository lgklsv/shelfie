The second edition of this hands-on guide shows you how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers—apps that can access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. Through code examples and step-by-step instructions, web developers and frontend engineers familiar with React will learn how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. You’ll learn how to extend React Native using third-party libraries or your own Java and Objective-C libraries. Understand how React Native works under the hood with native UI components Examine how React Native’s mobile-based components compare to basic HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Take advantage of platform-specific APIs, as well as modules from the framework’s community Incorporate platform-specific components into cross-platform apps Learn common pitfalls of React Native development, and tools for dealing with them Combine a large application’s many screens into a cohesive UX Handle state management in a large app with the Redux library",

        "description": "Develop native iOS and Android apps with ease using React Native. Learn by doing through an example-driven approach, and have a substantial running app at the end of each chapter. This second edition is fully updated to include ES7 (ECMAScript 7), the latest version of React Native (including Redux), and development on Android. You will start by setting up React Native and exploring the anatomy of React Native apps. You'll then move on to Redux data flow, how it differs from flux, and how you can include it in your React Native project to solve state management differently and efficiently. You will also learn how to boost your development by including popular packages developed by the React Native community that will help you write less; do more. Finally, you'll learn to how write test cases using Jest and submit your application to the App Store. React Native challenges the status quo of native iOS and Android development with revolutionary components, asynchronous execution, unique methods for touch handling, and much more. This book reveals the the path-breaking concepts of React.js and acquaints you with the React way of thinking so you can learn to create stunning user interfaces. What You'll Learn Build stunning iOS and Android applications Understand the Redux design pattern and use it in your project Interact with iOS and android device capabilities such as addressbook, camera, GPS and more with your apps Test and launch your application to the App StoreWho This Book Is For Anyone with JavaScript experience who wants to build native mobile applications but dreads the thought of programming in Objective-C or Java.

Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You’ll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you’ll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you’ll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you’ll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL. What you will learnDiscover TypeScript’s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainabilityUnderstand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using themImplement state management for your React app using ReduxSet up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratchBuild a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQLAdd authentication to your web app using RedisSave and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORMConfigure NGINX on the AWS cloud to deploy and serve your appsWho this book is for The book is for web developers who want to go beyond front-end web development and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web technologies and how they come together.

        "description": "Assemble the complete stack required to build a modern web app using React: MongoDB (a NoSQL database) and Express (a framework for web application servers), which runs on Node (JavaScript on the server side), complement React very nicely. This book will also cover many other tools that go into building a complete web application: React Router, React-Bootstrap, Redux, Babel, and webpack. Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React. The popular MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms. But it has its shortcomings such as lack of support for SEO friendly server-side rendering and being too prescriptive by being a framework. Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React – hence the term MERN stack. What You Will Learn Discover the details of React, the React Way, and how to get the maximum out of this library See the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node, enough to build a web app Work with other tools complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap and React Router Use the tools required to build JavaScript based SPAs Tie all the components together to build a complete web app. Who This Book Is For Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will find the book useful to learn about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is required.",

Explore the techniques involved in creating a full-stack app by going through a methodical approach. Learn to add CRUD functionalities and use Material UI in the user interface to make it more user-friendly. Book Description Apart from knowing how to write frontend and backend code, a full-stack engineer has to tackle all the problems that are encountered in the application development life cycle, starting from a simple idea to UI design, the technical design, and all the way to implementing, testing, production, deployment, and monitoring. This book covers the full set of technologies that you need to know to become a full-stack web developer with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to build a modern full-stack application in practice. This book will teach you how to build RESTful API endpoints and work with the data access Layer of Spring, using Hibernate as the ORM. As we move ahead, you will be introduced to the other components of Spring, such as Spring Security, which will teach you how to secure the backend.
